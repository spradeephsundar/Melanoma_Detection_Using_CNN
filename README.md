# Multiclass Classification Model using CNN - Melanoma Detection Assignment
> The idea here is to build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information
- General information: Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early and accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. 
- Business problem: To build a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network that can accurately detect melanoma. 
- Dataset: The dataset consisted of 2,357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). The data set had images related to the following oncological diseases - Actinic keratosis Basal cell carcinoma Dermatofibroma Melanoma Nevus Pigmented benign keratosis Seborrheic keratosis Squamous cell carcinoma Vascular lesion.
